#Wasquatch

**Welcome to Wasquatch.** You're guide to the sightings of the elusive Washington Sasquatch.

## Installation

To use the application take the build folder and copy it to the desired directory on your server. All other filed can be used for further development of the application. Tools that you should be aware of to continue development of the application:

*Grunt
*Bower
*Knockout
*jQuery
*Bootstrap
*SASS
*Flickr API
*Google Maps API

##The Interface
There are two primary area in the application:

*The map area to the right.
*The list view and search area to the right.

###Map Area

What you will find in this application is a map of all of the counties in Washington marked on a Google map. If you click on a marker you will see the name of the county, as well as the number of recorded sightings appear in an info window. Additional information will appear in the list view to the right.

###List View

By default the list view will be visible. To close it click the X icon. This view shows a list of all of the names of Washington counties. If you wish to get more information click the name and more information will appear below and the county will be highlighted on the map.

###Search

Technically it is more of a filter than a search, but if you enter character into the area marked FILTER the list view and map will filter the counties to only return those that contain the characters that you have listed.
